# General-Insurance-Reporting-System
A base structure for GI reporting, with Python + SQL + Power BI

There are four key steps in GI reporting work:
1. Collect data
2. Calculate
3. Save results
4. Analysis

All my work can be automated by:
1. build a sql data base.
2. read data and calculate in python
3. save results back to data base
4. power BI for visulization
